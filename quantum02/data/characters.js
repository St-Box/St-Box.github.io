        description: "A young physicist who inherits his father Arthur Hamlet's quantum physics legacy, striving to complete his father's unfinished work on quantum gravity and the unification of space-time theories. The cause of his father's death remains unresolved, and Hamlet is driven by both a desire for revenge and a relentless pursuit of scientific truth."

        description: "Hamlet's uncle and the representative of the classical physics school, Claudius takes control of the Elsin Institute. To preserve the dominance of classical physics, Claudius is willing to go to any lengths to suppress the development of quantum physics, even altering his brother's (Hamlet's father's) experimental data and tarnishing his reputation."

        image: 'data/images/characters/father.png',
        description: "Arthur Hamlet, a pioneer in quantum physics, proposed the quantum gravity and space-time unification theory. His research opened new frontiers in science, but just before he could publicly unveil this theory, he mysteriously died. Hamlet has always suspected his father's death was linked to a conspiracy orchestrated by Claudius. His father's 'ghost' is not a traditional spectral presence but exists as quantum information, entangled in higher-dimensional space, symbolizing Hamlet's internal struggle to understand the truth and fulfill his father's legacy."
