            A young physicist who inherits his father, Arthur Hamlet's, quantum physics legacy. 
            Hamlet strives to complete his father's unfinished work on quantum gravity and the unification of space-time theories. 
            The cause of his father's death remains unresolved, driving Hamlet with both a desire for revenge and a relentless pursuit of scientific truth.

            Hamlet's uncle and the representative of the classical physics school. 
            Claudius takes control of the Elsin Institute and is determined to preserve the dominance of classical physics. 
            He is willing to go to any lengths, including altering his brother's (Arthur Hamlet's) experimental data and tarnishing his reputation, 
            to suppress the development of quantum physics.

            Hamlet's lover, coming from an academic family. 
            Ophelia supports Hamlet in completing his father's theory but struggles to reconcile her emotions with the complexities of quantum physics. 
            Torn between her love for Hamlet and the conflict between her family and him, she often feels powerless amidst the ongoing scientific and personal turmoil.

        description: `
            Arthur Hamlet, a pioneer in quantum physics, proposed the quantum gravity and space-time unification theory. 
            His groundbreaking research opened new scientific frontiers, but just before unveiling his theory, he mysteriously died. 
            Hamlet suspects his father's death was the result of a conspiracy led by Claudius. 
            The 'ghost' of Arthur is not a traditional spectral presence but exists as quantum information entangled in higher-dimensional space, 
            symbolizing Hamlet's internal struggle to uncover the truth and fulfill his father's legacy.
